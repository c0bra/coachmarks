- [ ] BUG: when text is on right side of button, arrowhead is on left side of button instead of right side.
      And the start of the line is from the right side of the text, not left side.
      And if it's just a little bit above or below the button vertically, it will anchor to the top position when it should still be the side
- [ ] Reorient arrowhead so its angle matches a straight line from start point to end point
- [ ] Add basic (flexbox) positioning styles for text blocks (top, middle, bottom), (left, middle, center). Padding/margin can control the rest
- [ ] Relative-size the arrow marker based on viewport size
- [ ] Content needs to not scroll, which means scrolling elements into view.
- [ ] Handle rezizing, orientation changes, and media query changes
